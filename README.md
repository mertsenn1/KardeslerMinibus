## Project Description
We, propose an Android application that will provide the user with relevant information
about minibuses to ultimately make it easier for them to schedule their travel and/or find suitable
minibus lines within Ankara. To this end, the application will include a number of features,
including the routes of the minibuses in the database, the live location of the chosen minibus,
information about the driver, and the predicted cost of the user’s journey. This application will be of
interest to virtually anyone who uses public transport, and especially minibuses, in Ankara.
