### ~ Kardesler Minibus ~

## Project Description
We, propose an Android application that will provide the user with relevant information
about minibuses to ultimately make it easier for them to schedule their travel and/or find suitable
minibus lines within Ankara. To this end, the application will include a number of features,
including the routes of the minibuses in the database, the live location of the chosen minibus,
information about the driver, and the predicted cost of the userâ€™s journey. This application will be of
interest to virtually anyone who uses public transport, and especially minibuses, in Ankara.
