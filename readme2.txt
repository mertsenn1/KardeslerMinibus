CS102 Project - Group1C - Coming Soon 

Description of the Project 
We propose an Android application that will provide the user with relevant information about minibuses to 
ultimately make it easier for them to schedule their travel and/or find suitable minibus lines within Ankara. 
To this end, the application will include a number of features, including the routes of the minibuses in the database, 
the live location of the chosen minibus, and the information about the driver. 
This application will be of interest to virtually anyone who uses public transport, and especially minibuses, in Ankara. 
Eventually, the app will provide users with facilities that contain relevant and accurate live information and save their 
time without them having to wait for long durations for their minibus of choice. On the other hand, since minibus drivers 
move slowly along the roads in order to collect passengers, sharing their live locations would enable the users to find them faster. 
This, in turn, would also solve traffic jam problems caused by minibus drivers searching for passengers.

Project Current Status: We implement all of the features that we planned. The project is functioning as intended.
