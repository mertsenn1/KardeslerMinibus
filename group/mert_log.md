On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week I have watched tutorials about firebase authenticataion. I have connected our android project to firebase. I have written the code for sign-up and sign-in parts. I also made email verification, changing password from profile and forgot password parts enabled.
