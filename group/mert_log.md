On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 25/04/2020 ~
This week I tried to complete sign-in and sign-up design of our project.

### ~ 03/05/2020 ~
This week I have watched tutorials about firebase authenticataion. I have connected our android project to firebase. I have written the code for sign-up and sign-in parts. I also made email verification, changing password from profile and forgot password parts enabled.

### ~ 09/05/2020 ~
This week, I have created driver code dialog as a prerequisite of sign-up page. Since only the drivers can register to our application, we check whether the user is driver or not via this code. I get the code from edittext and compare the code with the codes available on database. If the user does not have a valid driver code, he/she cannot be directed to sign-up page and thus cannot register.

### ~ 17/05/2020 ~
This week, I learnt how to use Google Directions Api, and how to get the duration value from JSON object. After writing getDurationBetweenPoints(..) method, I combine it into the route adapter.
