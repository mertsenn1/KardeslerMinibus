On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 24-27 April ~
This week I learn how to use android studio (in basic level), how intent algorithm works and how xml code affects actual design. I also made a basic app that stores an information and prints it in the other page for the program profile page (includes java code). I also worked out, how a imagebutton icon made and how to use it. Now I am considering an (intent-activity) flow how to merge all other pieces. 

### ~ 27 April - 1 May ~
More on Android Studio... I also study about how to use firebase and location sharing in realtime... Watching lots of tutorials...

### ~ 1 May - 21 May ~
The more I interacted with android studio environment, the more I learned. In this time period, i learned; how to create a proper google map program in android and how to update the map and put markers in realtime (retrieve and upload data to firebase database), how to draw routes on google maps and how to implement it into an android program, how to use simple firebase functions and read documentations. I got familiar with how gradle files works, what android manifest files do, how authentication issues work. Besides, I learned how to find solutions online to the problems might occur. In a nutshell, in this project learned how to create a simple(i do not mean just printing "hello world" message) android program.
