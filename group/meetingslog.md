**Discussion:**
We discussed and distributed the UI components that we agreed upon previously. We made a sketch on a app design tool and agreed on the fonts, colors, icons, and the activities that are going to be included in the UI and will provide a sufficient UX. Every member has a design task to do via Android Studio. The tasks are as follows:

**ToDo:**
Mert - Driver userface (sign-in and sign-up design)
Arda - Adding map to the interface and a search bar to specify destination
Sebnem - Homepage design and route search page
Ege - Settings design
Bahadir - Driver userface (profile part design)

**Discussion:**
We analyzed the current situation and the progress we made thus far. We came to see that the tasks distributed in previous meeting are nearly completed and everything is going nearly as planned. Everyone has done their part. Some adjustments in terms of the user interface, such as fonts of text due to inavailability of the font in default Android Studio library, may be subject to change though.

**Discussion:**
The user interface stage of our application is finally complete. So we decided to have a group meeting in order to discuss the requirements of the backend logic of our application, in line with its planned features. In this meeting we decided upon the needed tasks that are paramount for the functioning of our application. We distributed the tasks among us. The tasks are as follows:

**ToDo:**
Mert - Driver sign-in validation and sign-up functionality using Firebase. Implementation of driver code to validate that they are indeed drivers. Implementation of duration estimate of travel.
Arda - Implementation of showing various route polylines on the map using csv files and Google Directions API. Implementation of showing all of the minibuses and passengers on the same route on the passenger map.
Sebnem - Implementation of settings logic. Implementation of finding minibuses on specific routes. Implementation of showing all of the minibuses on their specific routes. Implementation of filtering feature for the route search bar. Implementation of showing the minibuses that can transport the user to a specific location.
Ege - Implementation of receiving auto complete search results using Google Places API and programatically showing them on the map view with the given user input.
Bahadir - Implementatio of communication between our app and Firebase realtime database. Implementation of different endpoints both for the users and the drivers and updating the driver and passenger location data in real time.
