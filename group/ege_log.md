On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week I learnt how to use "xml programming language" and "Android Studio tool" in detail. Then, I did layouts (frontend) for Settings Page and Bottom Navigational Bar for the application 'Coming Soon'.
### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week I learnt how to use Firebase after the login and logout logic were implemented for the drivers. I experimented with the realtime database and tried to find ways to send and receive location data and update the map according to data we store in Firebase. I also did few optimizations on settings page to be able to achieve a better looking user interface. 
### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
In the past two week, I learnt how to use new Google Places API. I got Autocompleted Suggestions from Google Client for Searchbars in map activities. I learnt how to move camera in Map Activity and to add markers on those suggested places. I also designed an icon for App and optimized some bugs.
