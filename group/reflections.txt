What did we dislike about project work?
Since recent Google softwares are updated frequently, it is hard to keep track of current patch of the software.

Most difficult aspects 
When we look at tutorials and examples, we came across with different data types which used in specific functions and is not familiar, 
though it is hard to understand what these data types do in first glance, we also handle that over time.
 
What would we do differently if we had start over again? 
Since we have experienced about how to use internet to find solutions to the problems, which problems worth to strive more and so on; 
we would use the technology so that we would spend less time and do the project more efficiently.
 
How much time did we spend on it? 
We alocate our time
